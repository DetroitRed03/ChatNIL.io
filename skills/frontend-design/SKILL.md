## Design Principles

### Typography
- Use tracking-tight for professional, refined text
- Limit large text sizes (max text-2xl for values)
- Create clear visual hierarchy with size and weight
- Prefer semibold over extrabold

### Color & Gradients
- Use brand colors strategically, not everywhere
- Apply 80/20 rule: 80% neutral, 20% accent
- Single gradient per component maximum
- Warm neutrals over stark whites

### Shadows & Depth
- Neumorphic, subtle shadows
- Embossed surfaces for premium feel
- Avoid heavy drop shadows
- Soft, inset effects

### Animation
- Subtle hover effects (y: -2px max)
- Staggered entrance reveals
- Smooth, controlled transitions
- No excessive scale or rotation

### Layout
- Generous spacing for breathing room
- Professional padding and margins
- Clean borders (gray-200, gray-100)
- Warm backgrounds (#FAF6F1, #FFFBF7)
