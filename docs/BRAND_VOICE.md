## Writing Tips

1. **Use "you" and "your"** - Make it personal
2. **Active voice** - "Create your campaign" vs "Campaign can be created"
3. **Short sentences** - Break complex ideas into digestible chunks
4. **Avoid jargon** - Unless it's commonly known (like "FMV" after explaining it)
5. **Add context** - Don't just say what, explain why it matters
6. **Show progress** - "You've completed 5 of 10 quizzes" vs "50% complete"
