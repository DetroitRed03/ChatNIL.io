# ChatNIL Copy Quick Reference Guide

Use this as a cheat sheet when writing or reviewing copy for the ChatNIL platform.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Always use "you/your"** - Make it personal
2. **Lead with benefits** - Why does this matter to the athlete?
3. **Plain language first** - Explain jargon if you must use it
4. **Be encouraging** - Athletes are navigating complex territory
5. **Active voice** - "Track your deals" not "Deals can be tracked"

## Word Swaps: Say This, Not That

| ❌ DON'T SAY | ✅ SAY INSTEAD | Context |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| FMV / Fair Market Value | Your estimated value | First mention. Can use FMV after explaining once |
| Compensation range | What you could earn | Money/payment references |
| Deliverables | What you need to do | Partnership requirements |
| Campaign | Partnership / Deal | Athlete perspective |
| Engagement rate | Engagement | When possible, add context: "How often people interact" |
| Match score | Match percentage | Add: "Great fit!" or similar |
| Complete (verb) | Finish / Close / Done | More natural |
| Optimize | Improve / Boost | Action verbs |
| Leverage | Use / Take advantage of | Clarity |
| Utilize | Use | Always use "use" |
| Proceed to | Go to / Check out | Natural language |
| Execute | Do / Take action | Clarity |

## Form Labels

| Preferred Contact Method | Best way to reach you? |
| Interest Categories | What interests you? |
| Bio/Description | Tell brands about yourself |

## Numbers & Stats

### When to use words vs numerals:
- **One through nine**: Spell out ("three deals")
- **10 and above**: Use numerals ("24 followers")
- **Thousands**: Use "K" (247K, not 247,000)
- **Millions**: Use "M" (2.4M, not 2,400,000)
- **Money**: Always use $ and numerals ($15,000 or $15K)
- **Percentages**: Use % symbol (94% match)

### Adding context to numbers:
- ❌ "+12.5%"
- ✅ "+12.5% this month" or "Growing strong 📈"

---

## Voice by User Type

### For Athletes:
- Empowering and supportive
- "You're in control"
- "Here's what matters to you"
- Examples: "Your earnings", "Track your progress", "Opportunities for you"

### For Brands:
- Professional but approachable
- Results-focused
- Examples: "Find athletes", "Track campaign performance", "Discover talent"

### For Agencies:
- Collaborative and efficient
- Team-oriented language
- Examples: "Manage your roster", "Track all deals", "Team dashboard"

---

## Tone Adjustments by Context

### Homepage/Marketing:
**Tone**: Inspiring, clear, action-oriented
- "Your NIL Journey Starts Here"
- "Get expert guidance on rules, contracts, and opportunities"

### Dashboard:
**Tone**: Encouraging, data-driven, helpful
- "Welcome back! Here's what's happening with your NIL journey"
- "Great progress! You've completed 5 quizzes this week"

### Educational Content:
**Tone**: Clear, patient, knowledgeable
- "Here's what you need to know about NIL contracts"
- "Let's break down the compliance rules together"

### Transactions/Deals:
**Tone**: Clear, professional, reassuring
- "You're earning $25,000 from this partnership"
- "All compliance requirements met ✓"

---

## Length Guidelines

- **Button text**: 1-3 words ideal, 5 words max
- **Section headers**: 2-6 words
- **Descriptions**: 1 sentence (10-20 words)
- **Empty states**: 2-3 sentences with CTA
- **Error messages**: 2 sentences max + CTA
- **Tooltips**: 1-2 sentences (20-40 words)

---

## Emoji Usage

**Sparingly and purposefully**:

### ✅ GOOD Uses:
- 💰 for money/earnings (universally recognized)
- ✓ for completed/verified
- 📈 for growth/positive trends
- 🎯 for goals/targets
- 🏀⚽🏈 for sports (when relevant)

### ❌ AVOID:
- Multiple emojis in one label
- Emojis in formal contexts (contracts, legal)
- Emojis that might not render on all devices
- Using emojis as the only indicator (accessibility)

---

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Don't rely on color alone**: "Complete ✓" not just green
2. **Screen reader friendly**: "View deal details" not "View"
3. **Clear link text**: "Apply to this partnership" not "Click here"
4. **Alt text for icons**: Always describe what the icon represents
5. **Form labels**: Always pair with input fields, not just placeholder text

---

## Quick Self-Check

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. ✅ Is it personal? (Uses "you/your")
2. ✅ Is it clear? (8th-10th grade reading level)
3. ✅ Is it empowering? (Positive, not overwhelming)
4. ✅ Does it explain the benefit? (Why should the user care?)
5. ✅ Is it conversational? (Would you say this to a friend?)
6. ✅ Is jargon explained? (Or removed entirely?)
7. ✅ Is it action-oriented? (Clear next step?)

If you can't check all boxes, revise.

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Profile Completion
❌ **Before**: "Profile optimization incomplete. Navigate to settings module to configure required fields."

✅ **After**: "Your profile is almost ready! Add a few more details so brands can find you. [Complete Profile]"

---

### Example 2: Opportunity Match
❌ **Before**: "Algorithmic analysis indicates 94% compatibility quotient with this brand partnership opportunity."

✅ **After**: "94% match - This opportunity is perfect for you! Here's why..."

---

### Example 3: Deal Progress
❌ **Before**: "6/10 deliverables completed. Campaign milestone progress: 60%"

✅ **After**: "You're making great progress! 6 of 10 tasks done - keep it up!"

- **Detailed copy improvements**: `/docs/SHOWCASE_COPY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Questions?** Think: "How would I explain this to a college athlete who's new to NIL?"

**Remember**: When in doubt, simpler is better. If you need a paragraph to explain something, the copy isn't clear enough yet.
